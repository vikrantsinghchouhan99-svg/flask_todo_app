## 📌 About This Project

This To-Do App was created as **Project 2** of my internship at *Infotact Solutions*.  
I developed the project fully on my own — from setup, backend logic, database integration, and UI.

This project helped me strengthen:

- Flask routing & request handling  
- Using SQLite with Flask  
- Templating logic with Jinja  
- Building clean, minimal UIs  
- Structuring real-world web apps
